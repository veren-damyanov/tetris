# A Video Game Inspired by Tetris

Note that this project is purely an excercise in game development - it is not a commercial project, nor is it intended to ever become one. Any and all assets and code used in the project are purely original and nothing at all has been taken from any iteration of the actual Tetris.

The current build of the game should be playable [here](https://veren-damyanov.github.io/tetris/).


This project is powered by [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
